# Restaurant Project

## Task 13

### **Overview**
In this task you will continue building on what you achieved in the previous lab, you will use `Chart.js` CDN library to display the data from the table in two different shapes.

## **Requirements**

### **Set up your Github Repository**

- Today you will continue working on your `Restaurant` repo.
- Update your **README** file to add your changes for today.
- Check out a new branch called `chartJS` for today's lab.
- Open it in VS code.

### Inside **Statistics page** :
Below the food types table, create two forms of charts:

- `Pie` chart :

  After calculating the number of instances of each food type, create a chart displaying the type and number, you should have something similar to this:

  ![Card](./assets/pie-graph.png)

- `Bar` chart :

  Now for the bar chart, you are supposed to display the prices of each food and its name on a graph that looks similar to this:

  ![Card](./assets/bar-graph.png)

Take a look at [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) documentation and find out how to build chart graphs using this library.

Add more styling to your website, make it look professional, and just ready for lunch.
